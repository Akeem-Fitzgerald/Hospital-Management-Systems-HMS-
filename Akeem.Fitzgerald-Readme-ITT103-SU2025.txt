           Hospital Management System
-------------------------------------------------------

**Program Purpose:**  
This program simulates a console-based Hospital Management System (HMS) designed to streamline administrative functions in a hospital. It allows users to register patients and doctors, schedule and cancel appointments, and generate patient bills.

**How to Run the Program:**  
1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where the Python script is located.
3. Run the script using the command:  
   `python hospital_system.py`  
4. Follow the on-screen menu options to interact with the system.

**Program Functionalities:**  
- Register new patients with name, age, and gender, and assign a unique patient ID.
- Add new doctors with name, age, gender, specialty, and a unique doctor ID.
- Book appointments between patients and doctors, ensuring no time conflicts.
- Cancel appointments using their appointment ID.
- View patient profiles and doctor schedules.
- Generate formatted billing receipts with consultation and service fees.

**Required Modifications:**  
- Add file handling or a database connection if you want to persist data between sessions.
- Implement login credentials for different users (e.g., admin, receptionist).
- Improve the user interface using a graphical UI library like Tkinter or migrate to a web-based interface using Flask or Django.

**Assumptions and Limitations:**  
- The system runs entirely in the console; data is lost once the program closes.
- It assumes correct date and time input formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD and HH:MM).
- The appointment availability is checked only for exact date and time matches.
- Additional hospital services (e.g., test types or medication names) are not itemized.
